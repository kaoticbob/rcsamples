  <h1>Testimonio es Atole es Medicina: An AfterWord (TAM)</h1>
<p>An afterword I was asked to write because of my extensive relationship with LA Poet Laureate Luis J. Rodriguez (Always Running) and my past as a touring performance poet. The text is written in a style to be performed and brings together the major ideas of the anthology's authors while connecting the dots on how Rorgiuez's work can heal by the virtue of inspiring us to tell our own story. The concept of GenerousSymbiosis is introduced to frame Rordiguez's work not for the words he writes, but also how generosity is a "material" to his artistic practice that drives how he builds community and models in an intergenerational fashion </p>
