   <p>As part of the game night/performance experience Game Recognize Game/Bazi Recognize Bazi: a series of broken games, Grandma Invaders is a game performance site specifically designed to be performed in the Shangri La's Qajar Room. Ten portable computers become game consoles for the video game Grandma Invaders. As part of the performance's design, a host/activator The Game Player, excitedly teaches museum-goers the game, and rewards them for playing, and offers cheat codes to keep them in the game. </p>

<p>As part of the game-performance made for Game Recognize Game, the video game Grandma Invaders, developed in Unity in collaboration with a software engineer, satirizes the Space Invaders' game mechanic - kill demonized aliens. Space Invaders was developed the same year as the Iranian Revolution and the Iranian Hostage Crisis, when US foreign policy switched to demonizing Iranian "aliens." Grandma Invaders quickly complicates the targeted aliens in the game's mechanic by revealing that players must navigate through volcanoes, Iranian women fighting for their rights, threats to nature, military presence, and tainted water supplies. Players realize the win-state is to protect rather than shoot the "aliens" thanks to the wisdom of the grandma avatar inspired by my Iranian grandmother.</p>
