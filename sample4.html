  <h1>Game Recognize Game/Bazi Recognize Bazi</h1>
  <p>Game recognize Game/Bazi Recognize Bazi, a series of broken games, is a residency where artist Robert Farid Karimi designed site-specific ame performances meant to shine a light on playfulness and the power of FUN, generosity, and kinship at Shangri La Museum of Islamic Art, Culture and Design. </p>

Remixing a hip-hop term used to show recognition of someone’s ability or wisdom, the entire museum was transformed into a playtest of interactive games hosting 100+ local Hawaiian guests. Sponsored by the Duke Foundation, part of the design was to acknowledge the wisdom of local artists and Shangri La staff, who were invited to be playful and add their personal stamps to some of the games. </p>

<p>In these clips, audience members walk through various game experiences. </p>
<p>The start with </p>
<p> What [Set] You Claim?: is a game installation amalgamating a phrase in gang culture and mathematics, I invited the audience to form and claim with one’s “set” with strangers, friends, or anyone to be their co-playmates for the game night. </p>

<p>Audiences were given an envelope with Cards Against Humanity white cards to play with the Giant Black cards in the museum.  The envelope also had game pieces, stickers, dice, and other objects to be playful and engage the experience. Players were given tickets for playing games, being kind, and sometimes if they won, but mostly for being playful, taking risks, and being humane. They turned in their tickets to take home a Game Box to continue to be playful and share the chisme/gossip of what happened.</p>

<p>Players could roam to any of the 4 rooms/areas for the other experiences with the Museum, which used to be Doris Duke's home:</p>

<p>1. Grandma Invaders is a game performance site specifically designed to be performed in the Shangri La's Qajar Room. Ten portable computers become game consoles for the video game Grandma Invaders. As part of the performance's design, a host/activator The Game Player, excitedly teaches museum-goers the game, and rewards them for playing, and offers cheat codes to keep them in the game.</p>

<p>2. Cards Against Iranians...the Bling Bling Version </p>
<p>A card game meant to satirize the mechanic of Card Against Humanity (famed for being a “card game for horrible people” for its racist, sexist and homophobic cards) while poking holes at President Trump’s “Muslim Ban” which forbade citizens from certain countries in South and West Asia, Africa to come to the US.
Audiences play the game with game hosts from the respective countries of the “Muslim Ban”.
Several site-speciﬁc cards are installed in large formats to ask audiences to respond to the environment.</p>

<p>3. Unequal Backgammon</p>
<p>A classic race game is disrupted with unequal rules: black has only 6-sided die, and white has 20 sided die, and each player has to find a way to play an equitable game. </p>

4. Local v Settlers</p>
<p>Using the card game mechanic of War, this game had two Royal facing decks with site specific backing: a Settler and a Local deck, in honor of wars fought between Hawaiian locals and settlers. The game asks whether players can play and win the game of war without losing their identity.</p>
